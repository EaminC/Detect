Weekly Diet & Weight Evaluation (Nov 20–28)

For: Type 2 Diabetes | Starting Weight ~130 kg → ~121 kg

You’ve made significant progress this week. Your weight trend is consistently decreasing, and your daily food choices show structure, portion control, and a relatively low-carbohydrate pattern—very helpful for Type 2 diabetes.

Below is a detailed evaluation.

⸻

1. Weight Trend: Very Positive

Date	Weight (kg)
Nov 20	130.6
Nov 21	122.5
Nov 22	121.7
Nov 23	121.4
Nov 24	120.9
Nov 25	120.5
Nov 26	121.5
Nov 27	120.7
Nov 28	121.5

✔ Overall: Excellent downward trend

You lost roughly 9 kg from the start and stabilized around 120–121 kg.
Small fluctuations (±1 kg) are normal—usually water, salt, digestion.

⸻

2. Calorie Intake Analysis

Your daily intake ranges from 630 kcal to ~1,550 kcal.

✔ Most days: 700–1100 kcal

This is a calorie deficit, which explains the strong weight loss.

⚠ One outlier day:
	•	Nov 25: 1558 kcal due to a large portion of pork ribs
Still acceptable if it’s occasional.

Overall, your caloric control is strong.

⸻

3. Protein Intake: Generally Good

You are averaging 50–100 g/day, which is enough to:
	•	Maintain muscle mass
	•	Reduce hunger
	•	Support fat loss

Good sources you used:
	•	Pork loin / ribs
	•	Eggs
	•	Cod
	•	Chicken thigh
	•	Meatballs

This is excellent for diabetes management.

⸻

4. Fat Intake: Moderate to High

Your fat intake is often 40–100 g/day.

✔ Healthy fats: eggs, pork, cod, olive oil

⚠ But pork fat sometimes spikes intake:
	•	77 g
	•	103 g
	•	71 g

High fat itself isn’t bad for diabetes—especially low-carb eating—but:
	•	Too much animal fat may increase LDL
	•	High calories can stall weight loss if continued daily

Occasional is okay; daily is not ideal.

⸻

5. Carbohydrates: Very Low (Good for T2DM)

Daily carbs mostly 20–45 g, from:
	•	Cherry tomatoes
	•	Lettuce
	•	Baby corn
	•	Vegetables
	•	Minimal dressing

✔ This low-carb pattern is excellent for:
	•	Reducing post-meal glucose spikes
	•	Improving insulin sensitivity
	•	Supporting weight loss

Very well done.

⸻

6. Daily Food Pattern Evaluation

Strengths
	•	Lots of vegetables (lettuce, tomatoes, bok choy)
	•	High protein intake
	•	Reasonably low added sugar
	•	Almost no refined carbs (rice/noodles/bread)
	•	Calorie deficit most days
	•	Structured, simple meals — easier to maintain

Potential Improvements
	1.	Reduce extremely high-fat pork days (over 90 g fat).
	2.	Add more fiber variety (broccoli, spinach, cucumbers).
	3.	Add one more lean protein option to balance pork:
	•	Chicken breast
	•	Lean beef
	•	Fish
	4.	Limit dressings to 15–20 g/day.
	5.	Ensure minerals/electrolytes (low-carb needs salt, magnesium, potassium).

⸻

7. Diabetes-Specific Comments

✔ What you’re doing well:
	•	Low-carb → stabilizes blood sugar
	•	High protein → reduces hunger
	•	Vegetables → improve insulin sensitivity
	•	Low calorie days → promote weight loss
	•	Minimal processed food

⚠ Things to watch:
	•	Very low calories (<700 kcal) repeatedly can cause fatigue
	•	Excess saturated fat from pork
	•	Ensure enough micronutrients (BMI > 40 needs nutritional balance)

Overall: Your diet is extremely effective for early-stage glucose improvement.

⸻
